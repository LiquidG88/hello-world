# hello-world
<h3>My first repository.</h3>

**About me:** Self-taught programmer who is still searching for career possibilities. 
Currently learning and working with Python and some C++.

This repository will be used for storing anything from ideas to wacky test projects all in
one place as I continue my journey into Software Development.
